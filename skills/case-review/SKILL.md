# Evidence Graph Review

Use this skill when a reverse engineering, forensics, CTF, or authorized security case needs a defensible handoff. It audits the existing `work/<case>/` package without changing the case or touching a target.

## Scope

This skill covers:

- Scope metadata and target-activity readiness
- Evidence record structure and reproducibility fields
- References from work items and timeline entries to Evidence
- Structured Findings and Paths in report Markdown
- Optional SHA-256 verification for case-local artifacts
- A Markdown or JSON review result for a report handoff

It MUST NOT perform reconnaissance, exploitation, dynamic instrumentation, or target changes. Those actions belong to the routed analysis skill and require the case scope gate.

## ACTION REQUIRED

1. `NOW`: Read `../field-journal/precedent-reverse.md` and confirm that this is a review of an existing authorized case package.
2. `NOW`: Confirm the case path and choose read-only review mode.
3. `NEXT`: Read `../tool-index.md`. This skill uses only the Python 3 standard library and does not require bootstrap.
4. `NEXT`: Run `python3 scripts/review_case.py <case-root> --format markdown`.
5. `ACT`: Resolve every error. Rerun the review before claiming that the handoff is complete.

## Tool dependencies

| Tool | Required | Purpose | Auto-bootstrap |
|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Python 3.9+ | Yes | Runs the read-only case review script | No, use the platform Python installation |

No network access or third-party package is required.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Intake

Run the review against the existing case directory:

```bash
python3 skills/case-review/scripts/review_case.py work/<case> --format markdown
```

Confirm that `scope.md`, `timeline.md`, `workitems.md`, and `evidence/` are present. A non-strict review reports scope warnings while a strict review treats warnings as handoff blockers.

## Suggested next step (choose one number)

1. Fix the authorization, scope, or network_profile fields in scope.md
2. Continue checking reproducible commands and sources in Evidence records
3. Export the current review result and attach it to the interim report
4. Switch to JSON output for CI or another review tool
5. Stop and confirm the review scope first

### Phase 2: Traceability

Review the checks for:

- Evidence IDs that do not exist
- Findings without `evidence_ids`
- Paths without an allowed `path_type` or Evidence reference
- Work items and timeline entries pointing to unknown Evidence
- Unlinked Evidence records
- Validated Findings with low confidence

An offline observation may use `repro_command: n/a` only when its `notes` field explicitly documents the offline limitation.

Use JSON when another tool needs stable fields:

```bash
python3 skills/case-review/scripts/review_case.py work/<case> --format json
```

## Suggested next step (choose one number)

1. Add missing Evidence and retain the original commands
2. Bind candidate Findings to Evidence, then review again
3. Add P-IDs and Path steps for the call chain or attack chain
4. Generate a Markdown handoff summary
5. Return to the PRIMARY skill and continue analysis

### Phase 3: Fixity verification

When an Evidence record contains both `content_hash` and `artifact_path`, verify the case-local artifact:

```bash
python3 skills/case-review/scripts/review_case.py work/<case> --verify-hashes --strict
```

The script accepts `sha256:<64 hex characters>` and checks that the artifact remains inside the case root. A hash mismatch is a hard failure.

The PowerShell Evidence helper can record a hash while appending a record:

```powershell
powershell -File skills/scripts/append-evidence.ps1 -CaseRoot work\<case> -Id E-001 -Title "Sample hash" -ReproCommand "sha256sum evidence/sample.bin" -ArtifactPath "evidence\sample.bin"
```

## Suggested next step (choose one number)

1. Fix the hash mismatch or replace the contaminated working copy
2. Add SHA-256 and artifact_path for unfixed original files
3. Continue to report generation
4. Export JSON results for CI storage
5. Stop and request human review

### Phase 4: Handoff

Use strict mode before a final report or specialist handoff:

```bash
python3 skills/case-review/scripts/review_case.py work/<case> --strict --format markdown > work/<case>/report/case-review.md
```

The command is read-only with respect to the case unless shell redirection is explicitly used to save its output. The review is not legal advice and does not replace organizational evidence handling procedures.

## Suggested next step (choose one number)

1. Give the passed review result to `docs-generator/` to generate a formal report
2. Return to the PRIMARY skill and add new analysis evidence
3. Archive the Markdown and JSON review results
4. Stop and request human review

## Language behavior contract

- Internal reasoning, tool selection, and phase control: English.
- User-visible messages, section labels, reports, and next-step menus: Chinese unless the user requests another language.
- Default bilingual labels place Chinese first and English second, separated by `/`.

## Bootstrap boundary

This skill has no third-party dependency. If Python 3 is unavailable, the only allowed recovery action is the repository bootstrap path when a Python capability is registered for the current platform. If no such capability is registered, stop and report the missing runtime. Do not guess executable paths, download packages, or perform a manual install from inside this skill.

## Routing context

**Upstream entry**: any reverse, forensics, CTF, or authorized security skill that has produced a case package.

**Downstream exit**: `docs-generator/` for a formal report, or the original PRIMARY skill when the graph is incomplete.

**Related modules**: `ops/evidence-finding-path.md`, `ops/timeline-workitem.md`, `digital-forensics/`, `reverse-engineering/`, and `docs-generator/`.

## Task completion self-check

- [ ] I reviewed scope.md, timeline.md, workitems.md, and evidence/
- [ ] Every Finding cites existing Evidence
- [ ] Every Path has a valid path_type and Evidence reference
- [ ] I ran hash verification or recorded why I did not run it
- [ ] I reran strict mode and saved the review result
